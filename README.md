## The Task: 
Build a report based on an algorithm you have trained. 

## The Details: 
In this report you will find: 
<ul>
  <li>Part 1: Cover Page and Table of Contents</li>
  <li>Part 2: Choose a Dataset</li>
  <li>Part 3: Ask a Question</li>

  <li>Part 6: Train and Test Your Algorithm</li>
  <li>Part 7: Evaluate Your Model</li>
  <li>Part 8: Answer Your Question and Conclusion</li>
</ul>

The following parts are thoroughly discussed in the report. 

## Thoughts/Comments: 
I changed my dataset x amount of times (and also asked my prof for his opinion) before settling with the one I used which was Invistico Airlines. A majority of the datasets I found were more useful for a Linear Regression model. I looked at Pokemon and Elden Ring datasets but it was difficult to come up with a "Yes or No" type of question.
